# Hikmalayer Core

## What is Hikmalayer core?
Hikmalayer Core is a hybrid Layer‑1 blockchain prototype that combines Proof‑of‑Stake (validator
selection) with Proof‑of‑Work (block finalization). It provides:

- PoS validator selection, staking, and validator signature verification.
- PoW mining and PoW validation for every block.
- Governance and slashing configuration for validator accountability.
- Persistence of chain state to disk for safe restarts.
- P2P gossip and peer discovery for block propagation.
- A React dashboard for local interaction and testing workflows.

Hikmalayer is developed by Muhammad Ayan Rao, Founder and Director of Bestower Labs Limited.

This repository represents a production-focused hybrid L1 foundation implementing core consensus 
mechanics and operational services for future industrial-grade deployments.

For the official whitepaper, see `docs/Whitepaper.md`.

### Phase-4 Local Benchmark Results (API Execution Layer)
A Phase-4 local benchmark was conducted using a multi-container Docker Compose deployment (bootnode + validators + RPC + Prometheus + Grafana) to validate transaction execution throughput and operational stability.

**Environment:**

- Windows host
- Docker Compose multi-service deployment
- REST API transaction harness
- Prometheus + Grafana monitoring enabled

**10-Minute Sustained Run:**

- Duration: 600 seconds
- Total Transactions: 8,940
- Average Throughput: 14.88 TPS
- Average Latency: ~67 ms
- Reorg Count: 0 (instrumentation pending)
- Average Memory Per Node: ~4–5 MB

**Observations:**

- Continuous transaction load sustained without crashes.
- All services remained stable throughout the run.
- Extremely low memory footprint across all nodes.
- No chain reorganizations observed.
- Block production and finalized height are not yet included in this benchmark, as Phase-4 currently focuses on REST/API execution throughput rather than full P2P consensus orchestration.

**Scope Clarification:**

This benchmark measures transaction execution performance at the REST/API layer using a local multi-container deployment.

Full peer-to-peer consensus benchmarking (validator gossip, block finalization, fork handling, and genesis bootstrapping) is scheduled for Phase-5 (public testnet).

**Phase-4 Status:**

- Multi-node containerized environment operational
- Monitoring stack active (Prometheus + Grafana)
- Benchmark harness validated
- Sustained load test completed successfully

## Phase-4 Engineering Milestone: COMPLETE

- Benchmark artifacts are available under:

```bash
bench/results/run_10min/
```


## Licence
Hikmalayer licensing is split between source code, contributions, and documentation:

- **HikmaLayer Business Source License 1.1** for the protocol source code (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)).
- **HikmaLayer Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** for incoming contributions (see [`CLA.md`](CLA.md)).
- **Whitepaper** is released under **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)** to
  allow broad redistribution with attribution.

## Development process
Hikmalayer Core is developed in phases:

- **Phase 1**: Core PoW and chain primitives.
- **Phase 2**: PoS validator selection, staking, and validator identities.
- **Phase 3**: Persistence, P2P gossip, governance, slashing, and async‑safe services.
- **Phase 4**: Operational hardening, Dockerized multi-node deployment, monitoring, and benchmark validation. (Completed for API execution layer.)
- **Phase 5 (planned)**: Public testnet with full P2P validator consensus and finalized-state tracking.


## Testing
Run the Rust test suite:

```bash
cargo test
```

## Automated testing
Automated tests are currently run via `cargo test` and include unit coverage for chain validation,
transactions, and PoS selection.

## Manual Quality Assurance testing
Manual QA can be performed using the API and dashboard:

- Start the backend (`cargo run`) and the dashboard (`npm run dev` in `dashboard/`).
- Verify mining, staking, transfers, and validation flows.
- Validate P2P peer registration and block gossip by running two nodes with different ports.

For secured environments, set `P2P_TOKEN` and `ADMIN_TOKEN` to require `x-p2p-token` and
`x-admin-token` headers for P2P and governance/slashing endpoints.

## Translations
No translations are included yet. If you want to add documentation translations, create locale‑
specific README files (for example `README.es.md`, `README.fr.md`).
